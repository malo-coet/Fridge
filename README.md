# Fridge
A program made in 4 hours with @MÃ©lissaMiyou where you have a fridge and can stock ingredients and make pizza or pasta.

## Usage

 ! Case sensitive !

- "disp fridge" to show the total of ingredients.
- "addToFridge" to add an ingredient to the fridge.
- "make pizza" to repare a pizza from 5 tomatoes, 1 portion of pizza dough, 3 onions, 8 olives, 8 peppers,
4 portions of ham and 3 portions of cheese. 
- "make pasta" to prepare a plate of pasta from 5 tomatoes, 2 portions of pasta, 6 olives, 3 portions of
cheese and 4 portions of ham.
- "exit" to stop the program.

## Challenge
The challenge was to make a program 100% reliable. It has no memory leak and can't crash. All commands have a specific error line and the program will save the list of ingredients left in the fridge in a '.save' file.
